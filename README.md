# OVrCSU

It is an alternative implementation of the OV and rCSU contact map algorithm suitable to large scale and multiple structures analysis.

## Building

You need C compiler installed, type

```
make
```

you should get an **ovrcsu** executable.

## Usage

```
Usage: ovrcsu file.pdb

```

## Additional Information

The PDB parser included has limited capabilities. We strongly recommend to keep the PDB file as simple as possible:

- Including only one MODEL
- Keep the residues ordered
- ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE OUTPUT!

I've tried to keep the output as close as possible to the one available by the [rCSU server](http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/~rcsu/rcsu/index.html), however this software also prints a lot of additional usefull information.
